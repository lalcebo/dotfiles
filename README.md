# Lalcebo's Dotfiles

Check out his detailed documentation about all the files. I just changed a few things to better fit my needs.

Be careful when using these dotfiles because they change a lot of MacOS settings and install all the apps I need.

## Installation

1. `Update macOS` to the latest version with the App Store
2. `Clone dotfiles` to ~/.dotfiles (you will be asked to download command line tools)
    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/lalcebo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
3. `Run Installation` script
    ```zsh
    ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
    ```
4. `Restart your computer` to finalize  the process
5. `Set up Raycast`
